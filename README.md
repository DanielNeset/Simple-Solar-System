## Infromation

This is a assignment for NTNU IDATA2504 where we are going to make a simple solar system in Unity. We follow a tutorial form [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/game-design-and-development-1/solar-system-project-overview-jnFTl) to create this project. In this game one can see the sun, earth, moon and metiors. The sun is the main source of lights, and the camera is able to follow a planet one clicks on. An example of the game can be found and played at [itch.io](https://danielneset.itch.io/simple-solar-system).
